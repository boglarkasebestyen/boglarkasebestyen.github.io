keeping track of state: \n - all we need to know if it's an X or an O\n - have an array of 9 elements and fill in whether it's a 1 (X), 0 (O) or null\n - we'll also need to keep track of the next player\n\n\n- 2. what does the square need to keep track of:\n - keeps track of the mark made on it (X, O and null, null meaning it hasn't played yet)\n - we're also keeping track of the color, but that's not essential for the game\n\n #we'll need to figure out who's the winner\n  - loop over 8 winning combinations and check if state[i] in any line is the same\n  - if state[0] equals state[1]
