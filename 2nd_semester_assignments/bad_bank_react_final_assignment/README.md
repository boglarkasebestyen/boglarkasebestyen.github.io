# Bad Bank

### A React SPA without a backend
This project is my 2nd semester final assignment via MIT xPro's Fullstack with MERN course. It demonstrates the frontend side of a single page banking application built on following the provided user stories and with the help of the provided starter code. I have refactored its design, implemented the components, added additional validation criteria, as well as used React Context in order to share the required data between the components.

</p>


###  How it works:
The app allows users to interact with it by completing the form on the Create Account page, submitting their information, depositing and withdrawing "money" on the Deposit and Withdraw page, while having all that data bundled together and displayed in one place under All Data.

## Technologies used

- HTML5, CSS3, React Bootstrap, React Tooltip
- Javascript, React.js (functional, with hooks)
- deployed to AWS

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
