###Project Title: Bad Bank SPA with React
### Description/Motivation: 
This project is my 2nd semester final assignment via MIT xPro's Fullstack with MERN course. It demonstrates the frontend side of a single page banking application built on following the provided user stories and with the help of the provided starter code. I have refactored its design, implemented the components, added additional validation criteria, as well as used React Context in order to share the required data between the components. 

My 3rd semester assignment will showcase the same app with a backend, as well, using technologies, such as Node with Express, database handling with MongoDB, Docker, Firebase.


###Installation Guidelines: 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

###Technology used: 
- HTML5, CSS3, React Bootstrap, React Tooltip
- Javascript, React.js (functional, with hooks)
- deployed to AWS

###Features: 
The app allows users to interact with it by completing the form on the Create Account page, submitting their information, depositing and withdrawing "money" on the Deposit and Withdraw page, while having all that data bundled together and displayed in one place under All Data.

New features will be added via the backend, such as authentication and authorization.
